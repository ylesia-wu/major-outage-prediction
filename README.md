# Major Power Outages Prediction ðŸ”‹

By Yi Xing (Ylesia) Wu (xw001@ucsd.edu) & Junyue Lin (junyuelin608@gmail.com)

## Framing the Problem

A power outage is defined as the loss of the electrical power network supply to an end user. This occurrence engenders a disruption in the provision of electricity, leading to an absence of power in residences, commercial establishments, and other facilities. Power outages can have different degrees of severity. According to the Department of Energy, major power outages refer to those that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of at least 300â€¯MW.

Knowing whether a power outage event is considered major as early as possible is important for local authorities and organizations to take care of the ramifications of the outage. However, it is unlikely that information about the two criteria for a major outage, the number of people affected and the amount of unplanned loss, will be available right after an outage ends. Thus, determining whether an outage event is major is a crucial problem to be solved by a prediction model.

We will be using a binary classification model to predict whether an outage event is major. Since we want our model to accurately classify both major and non-major events, and our dataset is quite balanced, we will be using accuracy as our metric for examining model performance. 

### Data Cleaning

Just like what we have done in the previous analysis, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ylesia-wu/power-outage-analysis), we have converted the `xlsx` file into `csv` file, removed unnecessary rows and columns, converted the data type of each column as appropriate, and create new `pd.Timestamp` columns by combining existing columns. In addition, we created our response variable column `IS.MAJOR` by combining information from `CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED` and `DEMAND.LOSS.MW` columns based on the definition of major outages: outages that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of at least 300â€¯MW. Moreover, we created a new column `TIME.OF.DAY` by getting the hour of the day from column `OUTAGE.START`. There are missing values in multiple columns, but only a few of them are relevant to our modeling problem: `OUTAGE.START`, and `OUTAGE.DURATION`. To handle missing values in relevant columns, we used probabilistic imputation because we wanted to preserve the variance for the relevant columns. Last but not least, we split our dataset into a train set and a test set in the proportion of 3 to 1. 

Here are the first few rows of our train set:

### Prediction Problem: Classification
We are doing a binary classification to classify whether a power outage is major, which means `CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED` is greater than or equal to 50,000 and `DEMAND.LOSS.MW` is greater than or equal to 300. We will be working with different models and comparing their performances on the prediction task.

### Response Variable
The response variable, `IS.MAJOR`, is a binary variable indicating whether a power outage is major or not. It has two possible values: True for being a major outage event and False for not being a major outage event.

### Justification for Response Variable
We choose to classify whether a power outage is major because understanding the severity of an outage in real-time is crucial for local authorities and organizations to make informed decisions and handle the ramifications of the events.

### Features
Using `CAUSE.CATEGORY` as the only feature for prediction can achieve an accuracy of 85%-90% on the test set, but once it is used along with other features, it overshadows all other features. We will not be using `CAUSE.CATEGORY` as one of our features in both the baseline and the final models because we want to build a model that takes into account more factors, even if the other features will not have a performance that is as impressive as using only `CAUSE.CATEGORY`. Also, information about `CAUSE.CATEGORY` might not be immediately available right after the outage ends (time of prediction). We will be exploring other features that are available since we are interested in predicting whether an outage was major right after it ended. At the time of prediction, we will not be able to immediately count the number of people affected or the amount of loss. Instead, we only have access to real-time information related to the outage, such as the aggregate data of local customers, and basic information about the specific outage, such as the time the outage started and how long it lasted. 

### Metric for Evaluation
To evaluate the model's performance, we could have chosen metrics such as precision or recall. However, we are interested in correctly identifying both outages that are major and non-major and not mistakenly classify one as the other. Thus, we decided to use accuracy as our metric for evaluation. In our case, accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified outages out of all outages. On the other hand, precision measures the proportion of actual major outages out of all outages that are classified as major, and recall measures the proportion of correctly identified major outages out of all actual major outages, both of these aspects are of less interest to our problem.

## Baseline Model

### Model Description
The model used in this prediction task is a logistic regression model. The selected features for the model are `OUTAGE.DURATION`, and `TIME.OF.DAY`. We standardized the `OUTAGE.DURATION` feature and binned the `TIME.OF.DAY` feature into intervals during pre-processing. 

### Features
* `OUTAGE.DURATION`: This is a quantitative feature representing the duration of the power outage in minutes. It is a numerical variable.
* `TIME.OF.DAY`: This is an ordinal feature indicating the hour of the day when the power outage event started. It is a categorical variable obtained from the `OUTAGE.START` feature. 

### Encoding
* During pre-processing, we used the standardizer in sklearn to standardize the `OUTAGE.DURATION` feature. 
* We used KBinsDiscretizer to bin the ordinal feature `TIME.OF.DAY` into intervals. This encoding technique uses one-hot encoding to create binary columns for each unique bin, indicating which bin the `TIME.OF.DAY` value falls in.
* The 'remainder' parameter in the ColumnTransformer is set to `drop`, which means columns that are not passed in as arguments will be dropped from the model fitting process.

### Model Performance
For the testing set, the model achieved an accuracy of 67.97%, a precision of 68.06%, and a recall of 67.97%.

| Metric          | Score   |
|-----------------|---------|
| Accuracy        | 67.97%  |
| Precision       | 68.06%  |
| Recall          | 67.97%  |

In our dataset, 53% of the observations are major outages, whereas around 46% are not. 

| IS.MAJOR | Probability  |
|----------|--------------|
| True     | 0.532595     |
| False    | 0.467405     |

We think the accuracy score is not high enough because, if the model predicts all outages to be true, it will have an accuracy of around 53%. The accuracy we have right now is not very big of an improvement from 53%. The recall, accuracy, precision scores are not much different from each other since our dataset is pretty balanced. 

### Summary
Although our model is balanced in terms of different evaluation metrics, there is still room for overall improvement. To improve our model, we will conduct further exploratory analysis to look for additional features for our model, experiment with different classification algorithms, and fine-tune the hyperparameters.

## Final Model

### Model Choosing and Features:
After conducting several trials, we have decided to use the random forest classifier as our model for two main reasons. Firstly, although logistic regression performs well as a baseline model, it has a limited number of tunable hyperparameters compared to other models. This makes it challenging for us to fine-tune the final model effectively. Secondly, our dataset contains numerous categorical features, suggesting that a classifier may be a better choice. Here are the features we have chosen for our model:

- `CLIMATE.REGION`: transformed using one-hot encoding. This feature represents the climate region of the place where the outage occurred.
- `OUTAGE.DURATION`: scaled using StandardScaler. Scaling is applied for consistency and to prevent dominance by features with larger values. This feature represents the duration of the outage in minutes. 
- `IND.CUST.PCT`: scaled using StandardScaler. Scaling is applied for consistency and to prevent dominance by features with larger values. This feature represents the percentage of industrial customers served in the U.S. state. 
- `RES.CUST.PCT`: scaled using StandardScaler. Scaling is applied for consistency and to prevent dominance by features with larger values. This feature represents the percentage of residential customers served in the U.S. state. 
- `TIME.OF.DAY`: binned using KBinsDiscretizer. This feature represents the hour of the day when the outage started. It is obtained from the `OUTAGE.START` feature. 

### Model Performance

We utilized `GridSearch` to find the best combination of hyperparameters, including the number of estimators, maximum depth, and minimum samples in a leaf node. This tuning results in a score of around 77.86% for all three metrics: accuracy, precision, and recall, which is a significant improvement in the model performance compared to our baseline model. 

| Metric          | Score   |
|-----------------|---------|
| Accuracy        | 77.86%  |
| Precision       | 77.85%  |
| Recall          | 77.86%  |

### Summary
The random forest classifier yielded promising results for our prediction task. It enhanced the overall accuracy, precision, and recall of our model. Model selection is a crucial step in this process, and fine-tuning hyperparameters can further enhance model performance.

## Fairness Analysis

### Accuracy Analysis
For our fairness assessment, we have categorized the test dataset into two groups: power outages happening in spring or fall and those happening in summer or winter. Our primary evaluation metric is accuracy. 
### Null Hypothesis
We propose a null hypothesis asserting that our model's accuracy for determining whether an outage is major is roughly equivalent between the two groups, with any observed differences attributable to random variability. 
### Alternative hypothesis
Conversely, our alternative hypothesis is that the model demonstrates unfairness, and there is a significant difference between the accuracy scores of the two groups.
### Test Statistic & Significance level
We have selected the absolute difference in accuracy scores between the two season groups as our test statistic, with a significance level of 0.01. 
### Result
After running a permutation test 5,000 times, we obtained a p-value of 0.801, which exceeds our significance level. This outcome leads us to fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that our model, based on this accuracy metric, is fair. However, we cannot definitively assert the model's complete fairness as the permutation test results are also contingent on random chance. Hence, we recommend further testing with more data to verify if the model is 'truly fair'.
